## Development

To start the development environment, git clone the whole directory;

```
git clone https://github.com/gjrdiesel/hf-challenge.git
```

Go to the `web-designer-developer` directory and install the development dependencies via `NPM`

```
cd hf-challenge/web-designer-developer && npm i
```

Once the dependecies finish, start the local development watcher and start making modifications to `app.scss`.

```
npm run watch
```
